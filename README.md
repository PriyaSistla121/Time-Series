## Time-Series
## Project Overview
* This project builds Time Series model using Facebook prophit algorithm.
* The dataset includes confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across different regions, enabling data-driven insights into pandemic progression.
* The model is trained on the historical covid cases data to forecast patterns.
## Features
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
* Forecasting with Prophet: Predicting future COVID-19 cases using Prophetâ€™s additive model.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for improved accuracy.
* Visualization: Interactive plots to compare actual vs. predicted trends.
## Technologies Used:
* Backend: Python
* Data Handling: Pandas ,Numpy for data exploration
* Data Visuvalization : Matplotlib , Seaborn
* Machine Learning: Facebook prophit model for building time series prediction
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook
## Results & Insights
* Short-term and long-term COVID-19 trend predictions.
* Impact of lockdowns and seasonal variations on case trends.
